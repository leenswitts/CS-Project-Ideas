# Project Ideas

| Area | Project Title | Project Description | Links |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| General | Gmail API | Use the Gmail API to get your recent mails, send mails, etc |
| General | Delhi Metro Shortest Path | Use BFS to calculate shortest path between 2 metro stations |
| General | Graph Drawer | Outputs a graph (x-y graph) and takes equation as an input
| General | Professor Email ID's Scraping | Scrapes email IDs of professors of a college |
| General, Statistics | Plot given input shapes on GUI |
| Security | Basic Nmap Scanner | Be able to check for live hosts and open ports |
| Security | Keylogger | Script that records every key that a user presses (should execute in background)
| Security | Vignere Cracker | Crack Vignere cipher with zero prior knowledge of plaintext or key. Assumption: The ciphertext given is long (>1000 characters) |
| Security | LSB Image Steganography | Encrypt a textfile into an image by altering least-significant bits of pixels of an image |
| Security | Differential Setagography
| Security | Webcam Snapper | When this code is run, a snapshot via webcam should be taken every 2 minutes and sent over the internet to you. You can the images via nc, git clone, anything |
| Machine Learning | Naive-Bayes | Very basic ML project. Filter a given message as spam or not spam. Implement Naive-Bayes from scratch. |
| Machine Learning | K-Means |
| Web Development | Live Gaussian Curve Drawer | Be able to set sigma and mean and obtain the new curve simultaneously |
| App Development | Pacman game |
| App Development | Media Player | A simple media player that can play MP3, MP4 formats. Should have basic functionality play, pause, etc. Must have GUI-based  |
| App Development | Ticket Organizer Restaraunt | Let's the cashier choose order for the customer and saves the output in a text file. Must be implemented using GUI |
| Design | Soundblocking mask | Blocks sound you speak and transmits it to your phone |
| IoT, App Development | Pillow Alarm | You can choose a time for alarm via an app. The circuitry in your pillow vibrates when it is time for the alarm to ring |
| Algorithms | Suduko Solver |
| Discrete math | Convert popular relations to graphs. And do something with those graphs |
| Discrete math | Eulerian & Hamiltonian Graph determiner | Determine if a given graph is Eulerian and/or Hamiltonain |
| Systems | Kernel From Scratch | Build a very basic kernel from scratch |
| Systems | Linux shell | Able to execute 5-10 commands with some flags/parameters |
| Databases | Implement a user login-signup basic database which can withstand SQL injections |
