# Few Other Tips
> Some of these are existing/past projects on [my github](github.com/prabhatsoni99)

These projects are awesome for learning. However, if you are going to do a long project I would suggest you to do either of:
- Make something new
- Improve the existing technology. You can browse Github projects [here](https://github.com/search?).



# Project Ideas

| Area | Project Title | Project Description
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Algorithms | Suduko Solver | Use backtracking algo |
| Algorithms | Delhi Metro Shortest Route Finder | Make a graph of all Delhi metro stations, with the correct line and set up your own distances between stations. Use BFS to calculate shortest path between 2 metro stations |
| App Development | Plants Vs Zombies game | Implement first level. Would build knowledge of object-oriented programming |
| App Development | Media Player | A simple media player that can play MP3, MP4 formats. Should have basic functionality play, pause, etc. Must have GUI |
| App Development | Ticket Organizer Restaraunt | Let's the cashier choose order for the customer and saves the output in a text file. Must be implemented using GUI |
| App development | Polygon Plotter | The user tells you the shape he/she desires as {rectangle, circle, triangle, eclipse} and the necessary information to construct the shape (coordinates, radius, etc). Plot these shapes on GUI |
| App development | Snake-Ladder Game  | Simulate a Snake and ladders game  |
| Databases, Security | Secure Database | Implement a user login-signup basic database which can withstand SQL injections |
| Databases | DWRS (Delhi Waste Recycling System) | There are 20 collection points in Delhi and only 1 recycler. The recycler only collects from a collection point if it has atleast 100kg of waste. Each collection point must update it's local database to the recycler's local database about each collection point. This is to be done automatically every 3 hours. |
| IoT, App Development | Pillow Alarm | You can choose a time for alarm via an app. The circuitry in your pillow vibrates when it is time for the alarm to ring |
| IoT, App Development, Web Devolopment | Smart Dustbin | Fit an ultrasonic sensor on the top/lid of the dustbin to monitor how full a dustbin is every 10 minutes. Transmit this information to the web using Firebase API. Make a simple mobile app that sends out a notification when it senses a dustbin is more than 80% full. |
| Machine Learning | Naive-Bayes | Very basic ML project. Filter a given message as spam or not spam. Implement Naive-Bayes from scratch. |
| Security | Basic Nmap Scanner | Be able to check for live hosts and open ports. [nmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nmap) |
| Security | Keylogger | Script that records every key that a user presses. This script should execute in background. |
| Security | Vignere Cracker | Crack Vignere cipher with zero prior knowledge of plaintext or key. Assumption: The ciphertext given is long (>1000 characters). Assume the ciphertext to be all lowercase, words seperated by spaces and no special characters. |
| Security | LSB Image Steganography | Encrypt a textfile into an image by altering least-significant bits of pixels of an image. |
| Security | Webcam Snapper | When this code is run, a snapshot via webcam should be taken every 2 minutes and sent over the internet to you. The images should be acceptable to you using any tool - nc, git clone, etc |
| Security | Sieve of Eratosthenes | Generate all prime numbers till 10,000 using [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) |
| Security | Substitution Cipher Solver | Solve substitution cipher using frequency of characters (frequency analysis). Your solution does not need to give the exact plaintext. |
| Security | Block Cipher | Implement a very simple XOR block cipher using C. The encryption method should generate a random 16-bit key. You should be able to encrypt/decrypt binary data, and not just text files. |
| Systems | Reader-Writer problem | Implement a solution to the reader-writer problem with `k` reader theads and `k` writer threads. |
| Systems | Kernel From Scratch | Build a very basic kernel from scratch. Should be able to boot up. |
| Systems | Linux shell | Able to execute 5-10 standard shell commands with some flags/parameters. Examples: cd, ls, mkdir, rm, exit, true, etc. Write it in C |
| Systems | Assembler | Make a basic assembler that is given a x86 assembly file as input, and performs all those operations. Can write in any language. |
| Systems | Multi-User Chat System | Implement a chat system with 1 server and `n` clients. Clients should be able to talk to each other via the server. Donot use internet for the communication. The communication between different entities (users, server) can be via sockets or files. |
| Web | Gmail API | Use the Gmail API to get your recent mails, send mails, etc |
| Web | Graph Drawer | Takes equation as an input and outputs a x-y graph |
| Web | Professor Email ID Scraping - IIIT Delhi | Scrapes email IDs of professors of IIIT Delhi [faculty webpage](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/people/faculty). You would be required to parse the data in HTML format and search for strings. |
| Web | Live Gaussian Curve Drawer | Be able to set sigma and mean in a gaussian curve and obtain the new curve simultaneously. The changes should be reflected immediately. |
